                "Artificial Intelligence models are becoming capable of accomplishing complex functions like identification, predictions, generation, structured information storage and retrieval, harm detection, problem-solving and communicating in a conversational tone.",
                "AI models are already proving to be excellent copilots, personalised assistants, and agents to hire. As we started our research in Evolve Intelligence, we wanted to incorporate more capabilities into exciting AI ideas.",
                "Evolve Intelligence is being trained through Supervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning to think and communicate from a creator perspective. We collected data from wide sources in different languages and cultures to the greatest speeches and stories behind inventions and trained our model to provide some trivia information and a few backstories on each topic. Exactly like how a creator communicates.",
                "We believe this will help the user not just understand but remember the information subconsciously. We also study the psychological conditions of the human brain and try to build Evolve Intelligence in a way that will understand the user's state of mind and provide positive responses in a way that is not intimidating or superimposing.",
                "Progress monitoring and Suggestions are considered to be the key motives for the utilisation of Evolve Intelligence. We train Evolve Intelligence to provide mentored experience in project management and personalised individual progress.",
                "Another factor of consideration while training the Evolve Intelligence model is how to provide space for the model to transmute to perform cross-platform functions without human signalling by interacting with other systems and generating structured integrated output for the given query.",
